Copy issues across your (or your organization's) repositories.

1. Have one issue as a template to be copied, including labels.
2. Create a Personal Access Token in your [GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta). Make sure it is assigned to the same account/org where the repositories are. The Token needs Read and Write access to Issues.
3. Select a list of target repositories where the issue will be copied. You can choose whether check for duplicate issues with the same title and skip those.
